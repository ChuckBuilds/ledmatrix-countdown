I want to make a plugin for the LEDMatrix project that is a user customizable count-down. I want the user to provide a date, name, and uploadable image that the display will use the current date to count down until the target date. I want the user to be able to make multiple entries, I want the user to be able to enable or disable multiple of these entries, and I want to be able to manage the countdowns via the web ui. 

I want to re-use the image upload functions from: https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-static-image

The font size, color, and font should be user configurable.
